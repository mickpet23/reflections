When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all my work local if I am working with other people and other people need access to the files. Also, this might be useful for working from different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I might want to pull changes manually so that I can go back to a previous version. Also, pulling changes manually allows me to choose when my changes are ready. If it was done automatically, the changes might not reflect the actual job that I wanted to complete.
